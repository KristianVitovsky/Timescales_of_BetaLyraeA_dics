# Timescales_of_BetaLyraeA_dics
<br> Calculations of timescales in the Beta Lyrae A disc using classical steady-state Keplerian disc theory, Shakura-Sunayev(1973) models and results from a paper written by my supervisor Broz et. al. 2021.
<br> This is a code from research connected to my master's thesis. There you will find a summery of the theory and a discussion of the results: https://dspace.cuni.cz/handle/20.500.11956/179554
